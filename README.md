# cyber_resilience_analytics

This repository contains datasheet and scripts dedicated to the cyber resilience analytics work.
The following file are included:

    - "ANALYSE 2 - SWaT v5 ALL.xlsx" contains the resilience analysis made by applying the eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and WCC properties to the three SWaT designs;
    - "Chatbot_response.txt" contains the response provided by the Neo4J CHatBot to the question mentionned in our article;
    - "Data.zip" contains 
    - "FINAL_RESULTS.zip" contains the assessment results (available in "ANALYSE 2 - SWaT v5 ALL.xlsx") directly exported from Neo4j 
    - "Figures - SWaT resilience assessment.zip" contains the figures showing graphical assessment results with the eigenvector centrality applied to the SWaT three designs
    - "Figures Neo4j bloom.zip" contains graph figures exported from Neo4j after applied the eigenvector centrality, betweenness centrality and weakly connected components to each of the three SWaT designs
    - "SWaT_EIG.mlx" is the script for generating the figures in "Figures - SWaT resilience assessment.zip"
